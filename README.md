# TUF-Python
It's **TUF-Python**!... and in the working state. Yet. I still have to implement some features. Look at the list below for details.

- [x] Logging in
- [ ] Main menu for stuff
  - [x] Actual main menu
  - [ ] Browse levels
  - [ ] Browse passes
  - [ ] Browse leaderboards
- [ ] Submitting scores
- [ ] Viewing profiles

That's practically all the features missing right now.
